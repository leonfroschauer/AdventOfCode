# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
Advent of Code is an **Advent calendar** of small **programming puzzles** for a variety of skill sets and skill levels 
that can be solved in any programming language you like. Since 2015 [Eric Wastle](https://was.tl/), the creator of 
Advent of Code, publishes 25 Challenges from december the 1st to december the 25th. **Every challenge has two parts** 
that work with the same input (given as a .txt file). In this repository you can see **my solutions for Advent of 
Code**!

## General
### Types of Files
- **challenge.md**: Given challenge converted to markdown (Part one and part two)
- **solution.py**: Clean Solution of the Challenge
- *\[input.txt: Input file, given on the [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/) website]*
    - I don't upload my input files anymore and deleted old ones because Eric, the creator of AoC, wrote in 
      [a tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081) that he "asks people not to publish their 
      inputs [...] to make it harder for someone to try to steal the whole website"
